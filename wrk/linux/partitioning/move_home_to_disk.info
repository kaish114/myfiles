first of all format the disk with efi

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda6

now make a new folder home2 near home
mount /dev/sda6 /home2

sudo mv home/* home2/

umount /home2

now add blkid of /dev/sda6 to /etc/fstab like this

UUID=03ec5dd3-45c0-4f95-a363-61ff321a09ff /home ext4 defaults  0      2

now reboot
you will find home missing and now you will have to rename home2 to home in tty
reboot again

hurray it works


similarly you can move from disk to root-disk


DONT forget to change permissions and ownership of the folder
using
    sudo chown -R srb:srb ~/Documents
    sudo chmod +x ~/Documents
