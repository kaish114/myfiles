What's Wrong with git blame?

git blame only shows the last person to modify a line. This is rarely what you want. More often what you want is the original author of a line. Here's a list of things which changes who git blame shows as the author of a line:

    Changing line formatting or indenting
    Moving a block of code around in the file
    Renaming a file
    Any trivial change to the line
    Moving a file
