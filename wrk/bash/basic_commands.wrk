to make something autostart
    create its launcher .destop file
    copy the launcher to ~/.config/autostart/

    OR
    you may also insert a line of path in /etc/rc.local

mkdir
you cannot make a new directory such that path directories are missing
    use mkdir -p /sdfkj/skfjsl/skfj
    it will create a new directory only if there is not a directory
    else it will not //it is safe as it dont distroy old directory

cp
copy a file to a valid location
to copy a folder you have to use cp -r <path to folder>  <path to destination parent>
            NOTE: dont write folder name in second argument
            if there is folder already of same name it will be replaced
if destination is folder it will be copied inside into the folder

to copy all contents of folder do ...
    cp -r <path to folder>/. <location>
    OR
    cp -r <path to folder>/* <location>
        it will update the contents ... i.e introduce new ones while not effecting older ones
