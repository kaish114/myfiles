to build statically use the command

g++ -std=c++11 compressed_vcf_reader.cpp -lboost_iostreams -lbz2 -lz -static -o compressed_reader_static

note: we have to mention all the used libraries that is not in the case of dynamic linking
you can test whether binary is static or not using
ldd ./compressed_reader_static
