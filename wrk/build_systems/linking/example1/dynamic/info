to build dynamically use the command

g++ -std=c++11 compressed_vcf_reader.cpp -lboost_iostreams -lbz2 -lz -o compressed_reader_dynamic

OR

g++ -std=c++11 compressed_vcf_reader.cpp -lboost_iostreams -o compressed_reader_dynamic


note: we may or maynot mention all the libraries in case of dynamic linking
they will be included dynamically as required
to set path of dynamic libraries we can use
export LD_LIBRARIES_PATH=""

you can test whether binary is dynamic or not using
ldd ./compressed_reader_dynamic
